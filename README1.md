# JSL05: Guardians' Playlist Generator
# Introduction
The task was to create a personalised "Awesome Mix" playlist for each Guardians of the Galaxy, but use a JavaScript arrays and the map() function to do it.

# Elements Included
Array of songs, an object named 'guardians', and functions.

# Reflections
# Areas of Mastery
**Array Manipulation:** I believe I was able to demonstrate manipulation of the arrays using methods like 'map()', 'filter()', 'sort()', and 'slice()'.
**DOM Manipulation:** The 'displayPlaylists' function dynamically generates HTML elements and manipulates the DOM to display playlists on a webpage.

# Challenges Faced
Identifying and resolving the errors, handling exceptions, and debugging issues in the code seemed to be an area that I found challenging and time-consuming. As well as testing the application to ensure it functions as intended, because it is a larger project with more complex functionality.

# Overall Learning Experience
This project deepened my technical proficiency in  the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript, data structures, algorithms and software development methodologies. As well as promoting creativity and innovation in problem-solving.
